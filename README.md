# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction – Machine Learning Project

Wine Quality Prediction is a **machine learning project** that predicts the quality of wine (on a scale of 0–10) based on its **physicochemical features** such as acidity, pH, sugar content, alcohol percentage, etc. The project demonstrates the use of **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised ML algorithms** for regression and classification tasks.

## 🌟 Features

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes correlations between wine characteristics and quality.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, feature scaling, and normalization.
* **Model Training:** Implements multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, etc.).
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Uses Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix for performance analysis.
* **Prediction:** Predicts wine quality for new input data.

## 📊 Example Workflow

1. Load dataset: `winequality.csv`
2. Perform data cleaning and EDA
3. Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
4. Evaluate with classification metrics
5. Predict wine quality for new data points

## 📈 Sample Results

* **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the best accuracy (~85% depending on dataset split).
* Features such as **alcohol, volatile acidity, and sulphates** have the strongest influence on wine quality.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Deploy model as a **Flask/FastAPI web service**.
* Add a **Streamlit/Dash UI** for interactive predictions.
* Experiment with **deep learning models** (e.g., neural networks).
